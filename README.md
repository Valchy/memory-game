# Valchy Memory Game

Implemented from scratch using Next.js, typescript and tailwind css. It uses memoization to improve performance and XState as the state management library. I also use graphcms with apollo graphql as my headless cms. Finally, there are also animations made with framer-motion to make the user experience smoother and more enjoyable.

## Bonus

Try finding the easter egg in this game... Konami what?
